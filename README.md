## About This repositories

I think this all of these code will help the others to create and learn to code with a productive,
extensible and open development model.

### Beautiful user experiences

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

### Productive development

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

### Extensible and open model

Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all) but includes editor
plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio]. Flutter
provides [thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your development,
regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy,
with support for both [FFI] and [platform-specific APIs][platform channels].

Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found in our
[contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
